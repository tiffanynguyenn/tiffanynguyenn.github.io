  <p>This website is a draft portfolio for my CSC106 class! I will be learning and editing my webpage throughout this class.<Br>
   Everything on this webpage is material I have currently learned thus far in this class.  
   Hopefully by the end of this semester, this page will be filled with more material.</p>
